# T-57 - A Gateway Into Uncharted Space
This is a mod intented for use in the T-57 Modpack.
The mod itself adds planets, blocks, biomes, and items but requires the other mods in the modpack to make sense.

## Blocks
There are natrual blocks for the planets and also many industral and futuristic themed decoration blocks for bases on outer planets.

## Planets
This mod will add a whole array of planets replacing the normal minecraft dimensions and instead making you go to outer space for your resources. Currently 4 planets are explicitly planned but there will likely be 8-12 planets to complete the progression chain.

## Modifications
Not inlcuded in this mod are multiple minor modifications to other mods in the modpack for rebalancing, compatability, and a few other things.
